"The White House is turning to Google to build a new screening website for anyone wanting information on how to get tested for the coronavirus, President Trump said on Friday. However, there are some discrepancies between the White House and Google versions of what the site will be able to do, where it will do it, and when.The site will actually be built by Verily, the life sciences division of Google parent company Alphabet that focuses on research and development around health issues, the company confirmed.The president said 1,700 engineers were working on the triage website and that it would be done “very quickly.” Deborah Birx, the White House’s coronavirus response coordinator, said they wanted to bring it “across the continent.” Vice President Pence said they would have more information about when the website would be available starting Sunday evening.“I want to thank Google. Google is helping to develop a website. It’s going to be very quickly done, unlike websites of the past, to determine whether a test is warranted and to facilitate testing at a nearby convenient location,” said Trump during a news conference to declare the coronavirus a national emergency.But in a short statement shared on Twitter an hour and a half after the announcement, Verily said the website was only in “the early stages of development.” The tool will start in the San Francisco Bay area first with “the hope of expanding more broadly over time.”Read more here."

The decline became more dramatic this week, with Thursday the worst day yet.“The COVID-19 pandemic is making many of us stay home and our community of nearly 60,000 restaurants is facing a severe reduction in diners,” OpenTable chief operating officer Andrea Johnston wrote on a company blog, noting that “things seem to be getting worse quickly.”At the city level, Thursday’s restaurant traffic was down 37 percent in Washington, 52 percent in New York City, 38 percent in Los Angeles, 58 percent in Seattle and 22 percent in Miami compared with one year earlier.“Please support your local restaurants during this turbulent time,” Johnston wrote, suggesting home delivery as an alternative to going out. “Another option is to buy restaurant gift cards for future use.”Public health officials have cautioned against large gatherings and recommended that older people, especially those older than 80, avoid person-to-person contact.Sign up for our daily Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak.

"As concerns about the effects on the supply chain during the coronavirus pandemic mount, Patagonia has become the first major retailer to bow out — closing its stores and shutting down its website.The outdoor outfitter said it will stop business on Friday, reassess and give an update on March 27. All Patagonia employees will receive their regular pay during the closure, CEO Rose Marcario wrote in a statement.“The scale of impact is still unknown, and we want to do our part to protect our community especially while testing availability is unknown,” Marcario said.Some employees will work from home, and there will be delays on orders and customer service requests, Marcario said.Since the virus initially began spreading in China, where many American companies outsource production to, executives have expressed some uncertainty about how they will be able to replenish their supply, especially as fear has intensified demand for certain items like food."

"The State Department summoned China’s ambassador to the United States on Friday morning after a spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry accused the U.S. military of starting the coronavirus outbreak in Wuhan.Ambassador Cui Tiankai refused to comment on his conversation with David Stilwell, the assistant secretary for East Asian and Pacific Affairs, as Cui was leaving the State Department about 11 a.m. He ignored questions shouted by three reporters who followed him as he walked from the building’s front door and got into the back of a car.A State Department official said Stilwell gave a very “stern representation” of the facts to the Chinese ambassador, who was described as “very defensive.”Lijian Zhao suggested on Thursday that the U.S. Army was responsible for originating the infection in Wuhan.“When did patient zero begin in US?” Lijian tweeted Thursday. “It might be US army who brought the epidemic to Wuhan.”The State Department decided to confront the Chinese directly over what officials said was a growing disinformation campaign. Morgan Ortagus, a State Department spokeswoman, said China is seeking to deflect blame for its role in “starting a global pandemic and not telling the world.”“Spreading conspiracy theories is dangerous and ridiculous,” she said. “We wanted to put the government on notice we won’t tolerate it for the good of the Chinese people and the world.”The Chinese have complained that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and other administration officials and allies have referred to the virus as the “Wuhan virus,” in an effort to emphasize that its origin is foreign. China has called the word choice “slander.” The disease caused by the virus is known as covid-19.The State Department has been increasingly aggressive at countering claims by China and Iran, which also is struggling with an outbreak that has killed at least 500 people, the third highest number of fatalities after China and Italy.On Thursday, Iranian Foreign Minister Mohammad Javad Zarif charged that U.S. sanctions against Iran have caused medical shortages. Ortagus tweeted that Iran should release American and other foreign prisoners held unjustly amid fears the virus is spreading in Iranian prisons. She also rejected Zarif’s charge that sanctions were responsible for Iran’s medical shortages.“The U.S. offered — and continues to offer — assistance to the Islamic Republic of Iran on #COVID19 and the regime rejected it,” she tweeted. “We don’t discriminate.

"Trump announced Friday that the government is partnering with private companies to set up drive-through coronavirus testing sites after a week of unrelenting criticism from lawmakers and frustrated Americans unable to find out whether they might be infected.At a Rose Garden news conference, the president said the push to let people get tested from their vehicles would involve a new Google website to advise consumers about whether they should get tested and where, and big-box companies and drugstores that would host drive-through testing sites in their store parking lots. State and federal health workers would staff the sites and perform the testing, officials said.But several key participants said the administration was overstating the plans, including its scope, timetable and other aspects.“This surprised all of us,” said one state health official who requested anonymity to speak frankly about how state health departments had gotten no advance notice. “This is bizarre,” the official said, pointing out that many of the U.S. Public Health Service’s 6,000 officers are deployed elsewhere and could not readily be shifted.An hour after the news conference, a Google communications account tweeted a comment from Verily, the life sciences division of Google parent company Alphabet, that suggested the plan to build a broadly available website is nowhere close.“Verily is in the early stages of development, and planning to roll testing out in the Bay Area, with the hope of expanding more broadly over time,” it said.Read more about Trump’s plans to partner with the private sector."

"The Interior Department decided Friday evening to end tours at the Washington Monument, according to a senior administration official, making it the first National Park Service site in the country to shutter part of its operations because of the coronavirus outbreak.Interior Secretary David Bernhardt visited the monument Thursday and Friday with the Interior Department’s chief medical officer to evaluate the potential risk of virus exposure for tourists and employees there, according to two federal officials. To ascend to the top of the monument, visitors ride an elevator in relatively cramped quarters.The administration official spoke on the condition of anonymity because the decision had yet to be formally announced. Visitors can still walk around the monument’s grounds.Park Service officials at the Statue of Liberty and other park sites in New York City have asked their superiors for permission to shut down tours and access to monuments, according to two people familiar with the decision who spoke on the condition of anonymity to comment on internal deliberations. To access the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island, visitors travel by ferry.Asked whether Park Service officials in New York City had asked headquarters Friday for approval to restrict visitors’ access, Interior Department spokesman Nick Goodwin said in an email, “We have not received such a request.”Sign up for our daily Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak.

"President Trump on Friday praised the battered cruise industry — and shut it down in the United States for a month.In a tweet late Friday, he said major operators Carnival, Royal Caribbean, Norwegian and MSC had agreed to his request that they halt outbound sailings from the United States for 30 days, effective at midnight Friday night.The Cruise Lines International Association confirmed the tweet soon after, saying oceangoing lines would be “voluntarily and temporarily suspending cruise ship operations from and to U.S. ports of call.”Earlier in the afternoon, Trump spoke in support of the cruise industry, whose largest three companies are headquartered in the Miami area but incorporated in other countries.“As far as the cruise line business, we’re with them all the way,” he said during a news conference. “It’s a great business. It’s a great U.S. business.”Coronavirus pandemic tests clout of cruise industry and its long-standing ties to TrumpTrump also hinted that the federal government could offer a bailout to some hard-hit travel companies.“I can tell you it’s an industry that was very badly impacted by what’s going on with the virus, and it’s a great industry, it’s a very important industry,” he said. “And we will be helping them and we will be helping the airline industry if we have to, assuming we have to.”Last week, cruise executives from the four lines the president named in his tweet met with Vice President Pence in Port Everglades in Florida. Officials gave the industry leaders three days to come up with a plan to address the coronavirus threat, which has forced hundreds of passengers into quarantine.Among the proposed solutions are requiring anyone 70 or older to have a doctor’s note to board, taking the temperature of all passengers before they get on a ship, adding coronavirus test kits and staffers to monitor for the virus and conducting daily temperature checks on crew members, according to a synopsis of the plan."

"Fourteen states are closing all their public schools, as are several large urban districts — including Los Angeles, the nation’s second-largest, and Washington, D.C.District of Columbia schools will be closed starting Monday through March 31, Mayor Muriel E. Bowser (D) said Friday. Schools plan to resume normal operations April 1. West Virginia Gov. Jim Justice (R) announced Friday that all schools in his state will close indefinitely, WSAZ-TV reported.As of Friday evening, states that had announced school closures were Virginia, Maryland, Pennsylvania, Illinois, Michigan, Ohio, Wisconsin, Alabama, Louisiana, Oregon, New Mexico, Utah, West Virginia and Washington state.Closing schools is a growing trend across the country as state education officials look to contain the spreading coronavirus through social distancing measures, but the efforts present complications for families who rely on public education for food access and child care.State officials who had previously seemed reluctant to shutter schools changed course Friday, when a cascade of states began announcing closures.Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzer (D) said Thursday he did not plan to close schools. But, he said during a news conference Friday, his thinking changed after contemplating new information that came in overnight and through the day. He also said he had been thinking about state officials’ decision to limit large gatherings.“I really came to the conclusion that we’re telling adults, essentially, don’t gather in large groups, but we’re telling kids that you can bump up against each other in a hallway, even if you might not have an assembly,” he said.Oregon had worked hard to keep schools open, but student absences and workforce issues there had made it “impossible to functionally operate schools,” said Gov. Kate Brown (D). Earlier this week, she banned gatherings of more than 250 people, another social distancing rule being adopted across the country.An increasing number of cities and other localities, including Boston, San Francisco, San Diego and Sacramento, have made similar moves. Kentucky stopped short of a mandatory order but recommended that all schools, both public and private, halt in-person classes. Florida also provided “strong recommendations” that schools extend spring break.In all, at least 46,000 schools were closed, scheduled to close or had closed and reopened as of Friday evening, according to Education Week, with at least 26 million students affected.Sign up for our daily Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak.

"Though coronavirus fears are shutting down events nationwide, they’re not stopping one huge fundraiser in Pennsylvania’s Amish country that annually attracts thousands of people.In defiance of warnings by state and local officials, the two-day Gordonville Fire and EMS Company “Mud Sale” — where Amish-made quilts, crafts and furniture are offered up — started as planned Friday afternoon.The group went forward despite confirmed coronavirus infections in the state increasing 50 percent in the past 24 hours, to 33 cases, with tests on another 130 people pending. Almost all of those confirmed cases are clustered in southeastern Pennsylvania, though none has yet surfaced in nearby Lancaster County.The Paradise Township Board of Supervisors issued a statement Thursday “strongly encouraging” the event not be held. The fire company declined, saying in a statement Friday that canceling at the last minute would have “crippled” its operations for the coming year.Still, the group agreed to put in place additional measures to protect attendees. Most auction items are being moved out of enclosed buildings, hygiene informational pamphlets distributed and hand-washing stations set up at all entrances, restrooms, food vendors and other high-traffic sites.“We still believe it’s in the best interest not to have it,” Adam Bills, a Paradise Township supervisor, said after the decision. He voiced particular concern for Amish and Mennonite families, who live in close proximity to one another and, because they lack TV or Internet, have more limited information about the coronavirus. “They gather in large numbers in close quarters, so an outbreak could spread,” Bills said. “I hope that this helps educate the Amish.”These sales are held in what are usually “muddy” fields during springtime, hence the name. On average, they generate a third of local fire companies’ annual revenue and draw big crowds of tourists from numerous states in addition to many Amish and Mennonites shopping for new buggies or plow horses. Many of the companies have sizable numbers of Amish and Mennonite volunteers.The fire company’s Facebook page drew some angry responses to its decision to proceed. “For all of you foolish to attend,” one person wrote, “I have posted the address and phone # to the local hospital.”Sign up for our daily Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak.

The decision affects 114 sailings on 26 ships over the next month; the company’s brands include Royal Caribbean International and Celebrity Cruises.Also Friday, Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings said it would suspend all sailings through April 11 on its three lines: Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises. MSC Cruises will stop new voyages from the United States until April 30.The first to announce a global pause were Viking Cruises and Princess Cruises, which has been hit hard by the outbreak: Passengers and crew on two different ships, Diamond Princess and Grand Princess, have been sickened and subject to quarantine since February. The line said the stoppage will stretch through May 10.Britain-based Fred Olsen Cruise Lines said Friday it is pausing ocean cruises until May 23.

"President Trump said Friday that the federal government will buy enough oil to fill up the Strategic Petroleum Reserve in an effort to bolster crude prices and shore up the financial condition of U.S. oil drilling companies.The government will purchase up to 92 million barrels, enough to buy the entire output of Texas in approximately 18 days. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve, held in salt caverns in four locations near the Gulf of Mexico, currently holds 635 million barrels but can store as much as 727 million barrels.By buying oil in an emergency rather than selling it, the move runs contrary to the original purpose of the reserve, created by President Gerald Ford in 1975 as a response to the Arab oil embargo in 1973-74. That embargo cut supplies and sent crude prices soaring. The United States, then a major importer, faced shortages and gas rationing.In this case, the government is buying oil to bail out domestic oil companies when prices are collapsing rather than selling oil to protect consumers when prices are rising.Read more about the decision to fill the reserves here."

"Speaking in the Rose Garden on Friday, President Trump said he doesn’t take responsibility for the delays and shortages that have reduced testing for the novel coronavirus in the United States.“I don’t take responsibility at all,"" Trump told reporters, “because we were given a set of circumstances and we were given rules, regulations, and specifications from a different time that wasn’t meant for this kind of an event with the kind of numbers that we’re talking about.”When pressed by Yamiche Alcindor, the White House correspondent for PBS NewsHour, about the White House dismantling the office on pandemics, he called the question “nasty"" and suggested that Anthony S. Fauci, the director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, knew something he didn’t.“I didn't do it,” he said. “I could perhaps ask Tony about that because I don't know anything about it. I mean you say we did that but I don't know anything about it.”Fauci, who works under the National Institutes of Health, does not have purview over the National Security Council, which the team worked for.Trump also called the question, asked by Yamiche Alcindor, the White House correspondent for PBS NewsHour, “nasty.”In May 2018, after John Bolton became national security adviser, with the departure of Rear Adm. Timothy Ziemer from the National Security Council, a team working on global health security under him was disbanded, The Post reported at the time.Beth Cameron, the former senior director for global health security and biodefense on the White House National Security Council, said in a Washington Post editorial Friday that the decision most likely slowed the federal response to the coronavirus pandemic.“It is clear that eliminating the office has contributed to the federal government’s sluggish domestic response,” Cameron wrote. “What’s especially concerning about the absence of this office today is that it was originally set up because a previous epidemic made the need for it quite clear.”Public health experts at the time said the staffing change signaled that the administration didn’t prioritize science.Trump shrugged that off Friday, suggesting that it was not unusual.“Things like that happen,” he said."

"BERLIN — Poland and Denmark on Friday became the latest European countries to introduce new border controls, closing to all foreigners as the spread of coronavirus shakes the continent’s 26-nation boundary-free travel zone.Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said a ban on all foreigners would begin at midnight Saturday and run for 10 days but could be prolonged further, the Polish Press Agency reported. Poles crossing the border must quarantine for 14 days, it said.The ban came just hours after a similar edict from Copenhagen.“All tourists, all travel, all vacations and all foreigners who cannot prove a creditable purpose of entering Denmark will be denied entrance at the Danish border,” Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen said Friday.The Czech government, which had already banned travelers from 15 particularly virus-stricken countries, declined to confirm media reports that its restrictions had been expanded Friday.Poland and Denmark join several other countries in the Schengen Area — 26 European countries that typically have unrestricted borders — in mandating additional restrictions and checks. The European Union urged Friday that such decisions remain “proportionate” and coordinated.“In the last few hours we’ve seen travel bans and controls being put in place in a number of member states,” said European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. “Certain controls may be justified, but general travel bans are not seen as being the most effective by the World Health Organization,” she said.Von der Leyen said a more appropriate response would be extra health checks, including inside countries and at internal and external European borders. She added that proposals for new recommendations are being discussed.French President Emmanuel Macron proposed “reinforced” external border controls around the bloc in discussions with von der Leyen on Friday, his office said. That could include limiting travel from areas where the virus is particularly prevalent, it said."

"Starting at midnight, travelers on flights from 26 countries in Europe will be channeled through one of 13 U.S. airports, where they will undergo enhanced health screening, be given information about the novel coronavirus and instructed to self-quarantine for 14 days.The measures will apply to U.S. citizens, green card holders, their family members and other authorized travelers who have recently traveled from, or otherwise been present, within “a country of the Schengen Area within 14 days of the date of the person’s entry or attempted entry into the United States,” according to a directive issued by acting Homeland Security secretary Chad Wolf on Friday. Under the new restrictions, most non-U.S. citizens will be blocked from entering the United States from those countries.The 26 nations of the Schengen Area are Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Switzerland.The flights will be directed to international airports in Boston, Miami, New York City, Chicago, San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, Atlanta, Honolulu, Newark, Dallas, Detroit or Washington, D.C.The restrictions are part of several new strategies announced this week by the Trump administration, with the goal of slowing the spread of the coronavirus, which has sickened more than 1,800 people and killed more than 40 in the United States.Administration officials believe Europe — not China — is the new hot spot for outbreaks and want to reduce the number of people entering the United States from those nations.Wolf said arriving passengers will be directed to “enhanced entry screening,” where they will be asked about their medical history and current condition, and for contact information to be given to local health authorities. Passengers will then be provided written information about the novel coronavirus and instructed to self-quarantine in accordance with best practices from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.“While the overall risk of serious infection from the coronavirus to the general public remains low at this time, the Trump administration is taking these aggressive measures to keep the risk low, requiring all Americans returning from affected areas in Europe to be funneled through 13 airports for screening upon their return to the U.S.,” Wolf said in a statement.To minimize disruption, Wolf said airlines, officers from the Transportation Security Administration and the U.S. Customs and Border Protection will work to identify passengers who fit the criteria before they board their previously scheduled flights. Once identified, those passengers would then be put on flights headed to one of the 13 designated airports.“I understand this new process will be disruptive to some travelers, however this action is needed to protect the general public from further exposure and spread of the coronavirus,” Wolf said. “Once back in the U.S. it is imperative that individuals honor self-quarantine directives to help protect their loved-ones and communities.”The Trump administration has similar restrictions in place for travelers from China and Iran.Correction: A previous version of this post in one section mistakenly said there were six countries subject to new travel restrictions.

After the test was returned, he checked into the hospital in compliance with Queensland’s health protocols.Dutton visited Justice Department headquarters on March 5 for a news conference about an initiative to fight online sexual exploitation of children. He was one of six government officials who spoke at the news conference, including Barr and Wolf.With counterparts from Britain, New Zealand and Canada, the officials stood together on a dais for about 45 minutes to discuss the initiative. Given the number of countries involved in the announcement, there were scores of people who attended the gathering.The group also met that day with White House officials, and Dutton was photographed standing directly next to Ivanka Trump, President Trump’s daughter, and a few feet from Barr.Officials said Barr stayed home from work Friday but is feeling well, and medical experts have not recommended he get tested.“The AG is feeling great and not showing any symptoms,” said a Justice Department spokeswoman. “He is staying home today and has consulted with CDC [Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]. CDC is not recommending he be tested at this point.”A statement from White House spokesman Judd Deere said Dutton was asymptomatic during his interaction with U.S. officials last week.“Exposures from the case were assessed and the White House Medical Unit confirmed, in accordance with CDC guidance, that Ivanka is exhibiting no symptoms and does not need to self-quarantine,” Deere said. “She worked from home today out of an abundance of caution until guidance was given.”Kellyanne Conway, White House counselor to the president, also was present at the meeting and confirmed she met with Dutton but said she had not been tested for the virus.Yesterday 🇦🇺 Home Affairs @PeterDutton_MP joins @IvankaTrump, Attorney General Barr & our five eyes partners 🇺🇸🇬🇧🇨🇦🇳🇿 to fight online child exploitation.

James Brokenshire, the British security minister, said in a tweet Friday that he’d had breakfast with Dutton in Washington before the two went to a White House roundtable. Brokenshire said he is planning to self-isolate.The news of Dutton’s diagnosis came as Australian officials urged people not to interrupt their “daily normal routines” over the pandemic, even as they announced some sweeping efforts to contain it.The virus’s wide spread across many countries in Europe and Asia has yet to fully replicate itself in Australia, which has more than 120 cases and at least three fatalities.But the government response has not been without controversy. Australia quarantined citizens evacuated from Wuhan, China, at an offshore immigration detention center best known for holding asylum seekers.Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak.

He also urged Canadians to cancel or postpone any nonessential travel and for employees to work from home whenever able.The prime minister additionally announced a temporary ban on cruise ships carrying more than 500 people docking in Canada and said overseas flights to Canada would now be concentrated at several airports to limit possible transmission points.“We have to do this,” he said. “Because we have to protect our neighbors and friends. Especially our more vulnerable seniors and people with preexisting conditions.”Trudeau’s wife announced Thursday night that she had tested positive for coronavirus shortly after Trudeau said he would go into self-isolation for two weeks.The prime minister said Friday that he is not showing any symptoms of the virus and had therefore not been tested, per the guidance of medical professionals.“As long as I have no symptoms or I’m not feeling any symptoms, there’s no point in testing me,” he said.Reporters, however, questioned the logic of this protocol, given that he is in self-quarantine in the same home as his wife and kids, the latter of whom Trudeau said spent the morning playing with Legos.Canada had 157 reported coronavirus cases, as of Trudeau’s news conference."

"CAIRO — Iran’s Shiite theocracy is planning to employ near-martial-law tactics to contain the spread of the coronavirus, according to the country’s state television. In the next 24 hours, security forces will fan out across the nation’s cities, emptying streets.“Our law enforcement and security committees, along with the interior ministry and provincial governors, will be clearing shops, streets and roads. … This will take place in the next 24 hours,” state TV cited Maj. Gen. Mohammad Bagheri, the armed forces chief of staff, as saying at a meeting about the virus, according to a translation by Reuters.Within 10 days, Bagheri added that all Iranian people are to be monitored and checked via Internet, phone calls or in-person visits to determine whether they have been infected by the virus.Iran is among the nations most heavily impacted by the virus outside of China. On Friday, the nation’s health ministry reported 1,289 new infections and 85 deaths in the past 24 hours, bringing the total number of cases to 11,364 and the death toll to 514.The decision to deploy Iran’s security forces comes days after Iran’s Supreme Leader Ali Khamenei reportedly appointed President Hassan Rouhani to lead the fight to contain the coronavirus outbreak. On Friday, Khamenei ordered Bagheri to set up a “health and treatment headquarters” to fight the spread of the virus.The 80-year-old cleric also reportedly described the pandemic as an American “biological attack.” Iran also publicly slammed President Trump’s offer to assist Iran in battling the virus Friday. In a tweet, Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi call Trump’s comments “hypocritical displays of compassion and repulsive bragging.” To help Iran, he said the United States needed to end its sanctions on the country, which Mousavi described as “economic and medical terrorism,” so that medicines and medical supplies could enter the country."

"Louisiana on Friday became the first state to postpone its presidential primaries amid the coronavirus outbreak.The state, which was supposed to have its primaries on April 4, will instead hold them June 20, Secretary of State Kyle Ardoin (R) said at a news conference. State officials said they made the decision amid concern about older poll workers getting exposed to the novel coronavirus.“Louisiana is no stranger to natural disasters and well-adapted at navigating any situation Mother Nature throws our way,” Ardoin said at the news conference. “While hurricanes, floods and tornadoes are at the forefront of all Louisianans’ minds, the threat we threat from the covid-19 is an unprecedented threat and unlike any we have faced.” Covid-19 is the disease caused by the novel coronavirus.Ardoin said he certified a state of emergency Friday and requested that Gov. John Bel Edwards (D) issue an executive order postponing the Democratic and Republican contests. He said the decision was made with several factors in mind, including the age of Louisiana’s poll workers — more than half are 65 or older.“Safe and secure elections also mean safety for the people of Louisiana,” he said.Ardoin said the emergency provision had been used before, delaying the elections in 2005 after hurricanes Katrina and Rita and in 2008 after hurricanes Gustav and Ike.“It’s a very serious issue,” said Tyler Brey, spokesman for the secretary of state. “We’re trying to prevent the spread of [the virus] and take precautions.”The April 4 presidential primaries will take place June 20. The May 9 municipal general election will take place July 25.Ardoin said the delay would help his office “procure necessary supplies” to protecting polling locations and take other steps related to the coronavirus threat."

"With startling speed, the coronavirus pandemic has extended its tendrils into the halls of power around the world.For many top officials tasked with responding to the public health and economic crisis that has strained hospitals to their limits and sent markets spiraling, the matter is now personal. Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro became one of the highest-ranking world leaders to announce he would be tested for the coronavirus on Friday, a day after his communications director, Fábio Wajngarten, announced he was infected. Bolsonaro’s test came back negative, he said.Wajngarten met with President Trump last week at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. Trump has said he would not undergo a test for the virus.Canada’s parliament moved to suspend operations Friday after Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau went into self-isolation for two weeks Thursday shortly before his wife tested positive for the coronavirus. He said he is not showing symptoms of covid-19, the disease caused by the coronavirus, and has not been tested.Romania’s interim prime minister, Ludovic Orban, and his cabinet announced Friday that they were entering self-quarantine after being in contact with a senator who later tested positive.On the other side of globe, also on Friday, Australian Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton confirmed he had the virus. Dutton had just been in a cabinet meeting in Sydney on Tuesday.Spain suspended its lower parliament on Tuesday after the secretary general of the far-right Vox party confirmed he had the virus. Two days before, Javier Ortega had attended a crowded annual Vox rally.Last Friday, Nicola Zingaretti, the head of Italy’s Democratic Party, reported on Facebook that he was infected, too.Iran’s political leadership has been among the hardest hit. At least two dozen officials, including a vice president and the deputy health minister, are among the more than 10,000 people infected with the virus there. The official death toll — more than 400 — also includes members of parliament, a former diplomat and a senior adviser to Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Another top Khamenei adviser reported he was in self-quarantine Thursday amid unconfirmed reports he was infected.The United States — which has watched for weeks as the virus has marched through Asia and now Europe — is no exception. Some of the country’s high-profile lawmakers, such as Sens. Rick Scott (R-Fla.) and Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), are in self-quarantine after meeting Bolsonaro’s aide last week.

"CARACAS — Venezuela confirmed its first two cases of the novel coronavirus Friday, raising immediate alarm over the question of how an economically pulverized nation with a broken health-care system will manage to cope with the global pandemic.Vice President Delcy Rodriguez announced that the two patients who had tested positive were Venezuelan nationals — a 41-year-old woman who had recently returned from the United States, Italy and Spain, and a 52-year-old man who had recently traveled to Spain.“Both cases have been completely isolated,” Rodriguez said, adding that the socialist government is working to locate passengers on their flights, as well as other individuals who might have been in contact with them.Large public gatherings, she said, would be prohibited — something that could complicate the Venezuelan opposition’s attempts to oust President Nicolás Maduro, in part through street protests. Cinemas and museums will also be closed, she said.Medical experts in Venezuela have warned that the country is completely unprepared for an outbreak. According to the Global Health Security Index, Venezuela’s health system is ranked among the worst in the world in its capacity to detect, quickly respond and mitigate a pandemic.The average hospital in Venezuela went more than 300 hours per month without electricity last year. Eight out of ten hospitals reported water supply disruptions every week, according to a recent national survey. Doctors have decried the broken equipment, lack of hygiene and scarcity of medicines at hospitals as contributing factors in patient fatalities.Venezuela’s neighbors, particularly Colombia, which has absorbed hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan migrants in recent years, has warned of a potential new wave of “medical migrants” from Venezuela carrying the coronavirus and who could overwhelm its already stressed health-care system. Colombian authorities have recently installed heat-detecting cameras at the major migrant crossing points near the city of Cúcuta to identify migrants with fever entering the country."

The pair had traveled to the United States, where Wajngarten had come into close contact with President Trump and Vice President Pence.In announcing the test results, Bolsonaro posted a picture of himself giving a vulgar gesture toward reporters, then sought to undermine media outlets that had reported that he had tested positive for the virus.“DON’T BELIEVE IN THE MEDIA FAKE NEWS,” he wrote on Facebook. “THEY ARE THEY WHO NEED YOU.” The confrontational stance was a continuation of Bolsonaro’s long-standing antagonism toward the media, which he has repeatedly tried to discredit throughout his presidency, deriding news reports critical of him as untrustworthy.In the hours before Bolsonaro reported that he didn’t have coronavirus, numerous media outlets in Europe, the United States and Brazil published reports that the initial results of his coronavirus tests had been positive, citing Brazilian officials or even the president’s son, Eduardo.Eduardo Bolsonaro, however, is now condemning what he describes as fake news.“THE PRESS LIES TO DESTROY THE NEW BRAZIL,” the president’s son tweeted after Bolsonaro announced his test results.Critics of Bolsonaro, however, perceived something more malevolent in the contours of a very uncertain day.“Bolsonaro won a campaign of disinformation today,” tweeted political scientist Alberto C.

Local reports suggest the Spanish capital will order bars, restaurants, theaters and other nonessential businesses to suspend activity to limit social interaction as early as Saturday.“We are only in the first stage of fighting the virus,” Sánchez said. “We can expect very tough weeks ahead.

The testing facility will prioritize those who are most vulnerable, including New Rochelle residents who have been in precautionary quarantine, the governor’s office said. Swabs will be sent to BioReference Laboratory, which will contact residents with their test results.“This is a very creative way of testing,” the governor said, because it eliminates potential exposure to others in a waiting room, for instance.The six-lane testing site can accommodate 200 cars per day.

"The Trump administration announced a series of steps Friday aimed at boosting the availability of coronavirus testing, which has drawn heated criticism from lawmakers of both parties and frustrated Americans who are sick and have been unable to find out whether they are infected.The Food and Drug Administration has created a 24-hour emergency hotline for laboratories having difficulty getting materials or finding other impediments to running tests, according to announcements early Friday.Officials also announced they were giving nearly $1.3 million in federal money to two companies trying to develop rapid covid-19 tests that could determine whether a person tests positive within an hour.In addition, the Department of Health and Human Services assigned Brett Giroir, the assistant secretary for health, to coordinate all covid-19 testing efforts among federal public health agencies, including the FDA, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, state and local health departments, and public and private clinical laboratories. The FDA also is giving New York state the ability to authorize certain public and private labs to test for the virus under the aegis of the state health department, without first getting federal approval.Earlier this week, New York Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo (D) announced he was moving ahead to contract with 28 private labs in New York. “We’re not in a position where we can rely on the CDC or the FDA to manage this testing protocol,” the governor said. Cuomo said that he told the private labs they should “get up, get running and start moving forward with testing.”The state’s Health Department has a preexisting relationship with these labs, which Cuomo says has the experience with virology to get the testing done.The Trump administration announced these and other testing-related measures a day after a particularly harsh drubbing of federal health officials at a congressional hearing on Capitol Hill. At one House hearing, Antony Fauci, longtime director of the National Institutes of Health’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, acknowledged that the system for testing Americans for coronavirus is “not really geared to what we need right now … That is a failing. Let’s admit it.”Read more here."

"A stark contrast in the coronavirus mortality rates in South Korea and Iran show how critical a government’s response can be in determining whether the disease is stymied or spread. Public health experts say they want to ensure the U.S. outcome turns out more like the former.“Will we take the tough actions to mitigate spread, or will we let this spread like the flu?” said Scott Gottlieb, former head of the Food and Drug Administration. “I think we will end up somewhere in between: not helpless like Iran, but not as aggressive and swift as South Korea.”South Korea managed to dramatically arrest the spread. It’s conducting more tests per person than any other country in the world, with about 15,000 people getting tested every day. The government has set up dozens of drive-through testing centers. South Korean officials aggressively informed the public about how to respond, including with cellphone alerts notifying people of new cases near them.The country has reported 7,800 cases, but just 66 deaths — a relatively low mortality rate under 1 percent. Its daily growth in new cases also appears to be slowing. But it’s a different story in Iran, a country with 80 million people where cases are surging and several top officials — including two dozen members of parliament and a vice president — have been infected.As neighboring countries canceled flights and alerted medical personnel, Iranian officials said little in public about the virus. They didn’t announce the disease’s arrival in the country until Feb. 19, when officials said two people had already died.The country’s Health Ministry claims that about 10,000 have been infected and 429 have died. But mass graves — confirmed by videos, satellite images and other open-source data — could mean Iran has suffered more deaths than its government has let on."

"Scientists studying the novel coronavirus are quickly uncovering features that allow it to infect and sicken human beings.The coronavirus can be shed by people even before they develop symptoms. That pre-symptomatic transmission has helped it become a stealth contagion. The coronavirus may take many days — up to 14 — before an infection flares into symptoms, and although most people recover without a serious illness, this is not a bug that comes and goes quickly.The virus lurks in the body even after people feel better. A new study in the Lancet, based on research in China, found that the median length of time the virus remains in the respiratory tract of a patient after symptoms begin is 20 days. Among patients who survived the disease, the virus continued to be shed for between eight and 37 days.This coronavirus can establish itself in the upper respiratory tract, said Vincent Munster, chief of the Virus Ecology Section of Rocky Mountain Laboratories, a facility in Hamilton, Mont., that is part of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. That enables the virus to spread more easily through coughing and sneezing, and stands in contrast to another coronavirus that Munster’s laboratory has studied — MERS, which tends to infect cells in the lower respiratory tract, he said.Munster and his colleagues have conducted experiments showing that at least some coronavirus can potentially remain viable — capable of infecting a person — for up to 24 hours on cardboard and up to three days on plastic and stainless steel.During a CNN town hall program on the coronavirus Thursday night, Anthony Fauci, the longtime director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, addressed whether it is safe to open a package delivered by mail: “I think if you start thinking about money and mail and things like that, you can almost sort of immobilize yourself, which I don’t think is a good idea.”Read more here.Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak.

"As coronavirus infections mount, the federal government is preparing for an unprecedented experiment in remote working that brings with it a slew of digital dangers.The Trump administration is ordering hundreds of thousands of federal employees to be prepared to telework full time if the virus spread worsens, as my colleague Lisa Rein reports. And it’s far from clear government technologists are prepared to handle that strain.If U.S. adversaries, such as Russia or Iran, creep inside government computer networks, they could disrupt efforts to mitigate the virus by stopping or slowing down communications. They could also sow chaos by sending phony alerts about the virus to the government workforce or the public.Federal agencies are trying to get ahead of any problems as telework is being encouraged, though not mandated at this point. The Department of Homeland Security’s Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency is working entirely remotely today to stress-test whether the agency will be up to the job “if CISA-wide telework becomes necessary in response to the outbreak,” spokeswoman Sara Sendek said.But the government has never attempted to work remotely on anywhere near this scale before. At DHS alone, as many as 240,000 workers could be asked to work remotely; the CISA test alone involves 3,500 people.Read more here."

"For weeks now, America’s leaders and its public have been obsessed with one set of numbers: How many people have died? How many confirmed cases? And in what states?But to understand why experts are so alarmed and what may be coming next, the public needs to start paying attention to a whole other set of numbers: How many ventilators do we have in this country? How many hospital beds? How many doctors and nurses? And most importantly, how many sick people can they all treat at the same time?Consider the ventilators. For those severely ill with a respiratory disease like covid-19, ventilators are a matter of life and death because they allow patients to breathe when they cannot on their own. In a report last month, the Center for Health Security at Johns Hopkins estimated American has a total of 160,000 ventilators available for patient care.A planning study run by the federal government in 2005 estimated that if America were struck with a moderate pandemic like the 1957 influenza, the country would need more than 64,000 ventilators. If we were struck with a severe pandemic like the 1918 Spanish flu, we would need more than 740,000 ventilators — many times more than are available.The math on hospitals isn’t any better. The United States has roughly 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 people.South Korea, which has seen success mitigating its large outbreak, has more than 12 hospital beds per 1,000 people. China, where hospitals in Hubei were quickly overrun, has 4.3 beds per 1,000. Italy, a developed country with a reasonably decent health system, has seen its hospitals overwhelmed and has 3.2 beds per 1,000.Read more here."

"Wall Street was poised for a rebound Friday after its most brutal sell-off in more than 30 years, as central banks around the world delivered expansive packages to try to shore up the economy against the novel coronavirus outbreak, which has battered global markets for weeks and disrupted nearly every facet of daily life.Dow Jones industrial average futures are calling for a more than 1,100-point spike at the open. The Standard & Poor’s 500 and Nasdaq are also signaling surges in excess of 5 percent. Emergency action by the Federal Reserve to free up $1.5 trillion to smooth operations of the massive U.S. Treasury market and an Oval Office speech from President Trump outlining the beginning of the White House’s response to the U.S. outbreak sent investors into complete panic Wednesday, resulting in a jaw-dropping 10 percent decline for the Dow and the week’s second forced halt to trading.Wall Street’s stunning meltdown over the past month has erased most of the stock market gains since Trump’s election in November 2016.

"BERLIN — Some of the world’s top experts tracking the spread of the coronavirus predict that in a matter of weeks, much of Europe could be facing a similar surge in cases that has locked down Italy, overwhelmed its hospitals in the north and brought the country of 60 million to a standstill.Mathematical models developed by epidemiologists to track the virus show a sharp trajectory of infections in Germany, France and Britain. Spain showed particularly concerning exponential growth, some experts said. The modelers in Europe say a similar arc is likely in the United States, but anticipating the spread is made more difficult by the lack of widespread testing of suspected cases there.“Italy is about two weeks ahead of Britain and the rest of Europe,” said Francois Balloux, director of the Genetics Institute at University College London. Observations by epidemiologists show that if unchecked, the number of infections doubles approximately every five days, with infected individuals capable of passing the virus on to an average of about 2.5 people. “What we are seeing is not rocket science,” Balloux said.Epidemiologists say that decisive action is required to change the rate of infection and “flatten the curve.” That reality appeared to sink in for some political leaders in the United States and Europe this week, as countries closed schools, encouraged working from home, banned large gatherings and imposed new travel restrictions. French Health Ministry Director General Jérôme Salomon said France must prepare itself for “the Italian scenario.” Still, some experts worry that governments aren’t doing enough to reduce rates of transmission so cases don’t soar exponentially and overwhelm health systems. A lack of urgency in previous weeks may have wasted valuable time, they say.Read more here."

"BERLIN — As coronavirus cases continued to surge across Europe Friday, governments took more decisive but differing measures to slow down the spread of the virus.In Italy, a nationwide lockdown continued, as almost 13,000 people were confirmed to be infected by the virus Thursday night. Known current cases increased by more than 2,000 within 24 hours.In central Europe, Poland’s president canceled a planned trip to Russia. The Czech Republic announced self-quarantine rules for travelers from 15 countries, including neighboring Germany.Meanwhile, some German federal states began announcing school closures Friday, as confirmed cases there exceeded 2,000, but other states remained reluctant to shut down educational institutions.In Spain, where figures surged this week, the death toll nearly doubled. As of Thursday, it stood at 84, according to local health officials.Meanwhile, there were signs that the outbreak now covered a wide geographic area. In Bulgaria, the parliament voted to declare a state of emergency, which will last one month, after confirmed cases in the country exceeded 20.In Romania, interim prime minister Ludovic Orban said he would self-isolate after he came in contact with an individual who was later confirmed to have the virus.Facing criticism over its handling of the public health crisis, the European Commission was expected to drop spending restrictions that normally apply to member states but have hindered efforts to boost virus-stricken economies.Sign up for our Coronavirus Updates newsletter to track the outbreak.

"NEW DELHI – Zomato and Swiggy, India’s most popular food delivery apps, announced that customers can opt for “contactless” deliveries as a precautionary measure to check the spread of coronavirus. In emails sent to customers this week, reviewed by The Washington Post, the companies said that food packets can be left at the customer’s door, if they wanted. Zomato customers will receive a photo of the delivered food as confirmation.Both companies said they were training their delivery fleets in best practices of hygiene and had asked them to self-quarantine if they showed any symptoms. Swiggy said it would provide “free medical consultation.”Zomato’s founder, Deepinder Goyal, said in a tweet that the company had informed it’s delivery staff that, “they don’t need to force themselves to work for financial reasons.” The company would provide financial support besides medical insurance for those affected. Media reports suggest that in December the two companies combined received over 2.5 million orders daily.India’s health ministry has so far reported one death and confirmed 75 positive coronavirus cases. The government has virtually quarantined the country by suspending all short-term visas and sealing land borders in a rash of strict measures to deal the virus.

"BERLIN — Two days after German Chancellor Angela Merkel addressed the nation with a blunt warning — that more than two-thirds of the population could be infected by coronavirus — many German schools remained open on Friday.As other nations across the continent shut schools and universities, including neighboring France, the German approach appeared to stand out, revealing the country’s struggle to confront the virus in a federal system similar to the United States.Earlier this week, German Health Minister Jens Spahn had urged the cancellation of big gatherings, but he only could offer a recommendation rather than an outright ban. Under German federal law, such cancellations can only be enforced by the 16 federal states.The chaos that ensued — with some states pushing ahead with immediate cancellations and other regional governments appearing to hesitate — is now once again playing out with school closures, critics argue.By Friday morning, the governments of Bavaria, Saarland and Berlin had decided to close their schools. Elsewhere, teachers continued to lack instructions.Opponents of school closures argue that infection rates there have been relatively low and that sending children home would prevent many parents from being able to work. Case tallies have also strongly differed between federal states, which has made school closures a more pressing concern in some federal states that have already taken action.But others disagreed. “If the reality is that we all live in the same country and the same world, then it’s unacceptable that schools are closed [in some areas] but not a few kilometers away,” said Heinz-Peter Meidinger, the president of the German teachers’ association, according to Germany’s public broadcaster.In the Netherlands, the government faced similarly harsh criticism during a parliamentary debate overnight, after it closed museums and banned many gatherings, but kept schools and universities open."

Travel restrictions against countries like China, South Korea, Italy and Iran are already in place.These new restrictions will come into effect on Sunday at 11:59 p.m., officials said, citing a “tenfold increase” in coronavirus cases outside of mainland China. In Singapore, as of Thursday, a quarter of the 187 confirmed cases were imported, the government said — including 13 cases with recent travel history to European countries, and six cases from Indonesia in the past 10 days alone.Singapore has also changed measures for those exhibiting symptoms of respiratory illnesses. Since March 4, all travelers with symptoms have had to do a mandatory swab test for covid-19, regardless of their travel history. With immediate effect, all travelers exhibiting any respiratory symptoms will have to self-quarantine, even if the test results come up negative. Port calls for all cruises have also ceased with immediate effect.Lee Hsien Loong, Singapore’s prime minister, said in a national address Thursday that though his country had taken the situation with “utmost seriousness,” Singapore too faces a “serious situation” and expects new clusters and waves of infections coming from many countries rather than one or two.

"The Trump administration and congressional Democrats are close to agreeing on economic relief measures intended to help people and businesses affected by the new coronavirus, they say, as the pandemic leads to more cancellations and generates more uncertainty from the public.On Thursday alone, major theme parks, houses of worship, museums and cruises said they will shut down. The country’s professional hockey, basketball and soccer leagues suspended their seasons. Small towns have emptied out, big cities have banned large gatherings, and at least five states announced they will close all schools.Amid intense pressure from both sides, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said she expected a vote Friday ”one way or another” to approve the economic relief package. Expected to total several tens of billions of dollars, it will include expanded unemployment insurance, paid sick leave and food security assistance, as well as free coronavirus testing.But concerns about testing are already well underway, vexing laboratories, health officials and patients across the country. Strict regulations on who can be tested mean that not everyone who wants one has been able to get one, despite President Trump’s sweeping declarations to the contrary.As of early Friday, more than 1,600 cases of the virus were being treated across the United States, including at least one patient in nearly every state and the District of Columbia. But experts — including many government officials — say the spread of the virus may be far more pronounced.The coronavirus increasingly appears to be turning into one of the biggest tests for Trump’s presidency, it has taken a toll on him personally. As many of his family’s hotels and clubs shut down this week, a Brazilian official who had been photographed next to him and Vice President Mike Pence tested positive for the virus.On the Democratic campaign trail, meanwhile, both Sen. Bernie Sanders and former vice president Joseph R. Biden Jr. slammed the president for his response to the virus. And the president hit back.Late on Thursday, Trump said Biden’s efforts to curb the H1N1 swine flu epidemic in the Obama administration were some “one of the worst on record.”“Our response is one of the best,” Trump said on Twitter.Have you tried to get tested for coronavirus and been turned away?

"Diseases know no borders, but President Trump seems to think otherwise. In an address to the nation Wednesday, he called the coronavirus spreading a “foreign virus,” an external menace that originated in China and was handled improperly by the United States’ European allies. He slapped a 30-day travel ban on most of Europe, to the bemusement of officials in Brussels, and tried to spin an earlier decision to block travel from China as a prescient measure.Trump also hailed his administration’s mobilization of federal resources to combat the spread of the disease. “The virus will not have a chance against us,” he said.But that bravado, which preceded the worst day for U.S. stocks since 1987, appeared to backfire. “From the misstatements to the omissions to his labored demeanor, the president sent a message that shook financial markets, disrupted relations with European allies, confused his many viewers and undermined the most precious commodity of any president, his credibility,” wrote The Post’s Dan Balz.On Thursday, Trump flummoxed onlookers when he told reporters that the United States had “a tremendous testing set up” despite widespread complaints that medical facilities aren’t providing tests or are taking too long to provide results. In the view of many European officials, Trump’s rhetoric and travel ban smacked of naked ideology, not sound public health policy. After all, quite a few countries from within Europe’s Schengen zone — targeted by the U.S. ban because of the open borders policy inside it — had reported smaller numbers of coronavirus cases than Britain, which was exempt from the restrictions.Read more in today’s WorldView analysis here."
